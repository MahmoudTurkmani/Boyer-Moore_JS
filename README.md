# Boyer-Moore Algorithm implementation

Implementation of the Boyer-Moore string searching algorithm using JavaScript done for the Algorithms course assignment.

The repository consists of two files that execute the same algorithm:
- [Boyer-Moore Detailed](https://github.com/MahmoudTurkmani/Boyer-Moore_JS/blob/master/boyer-moore-detailed.js) executes the algorithm and shows all the steps that are taken until it reaches the answer
- [Boyer-Moore Simplified](https://github.com/MahmoudTurkmani/Boyer-Moore_JS/blob/master/boyer-moore-simplified.js) simply returns the output of the algorithm

## How to use
To use the implementation, you will need to perform two changes:
1. Replace `inputText`'s value with the string you wish to search through
2. Replace `pattern`'s value with the pattern you wish to look for inside of `inputText`

You may then run the file using either `NodeJS` through the command line or through a JavaScript compiler
